                                        <p>The Los Angeles Theatre was completed in 1931 with a budget of $1.5 million and in only less than six months. It was one the the last and most extravagant of these magnificent theatres built on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles and contains a six-story main lobby and a 2200-seat auditorium. Architect S. Charles Lee was hired by H.L. Gumbiner to design the LA Theatre, and Lee chose to model it after the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. Both Gumbiner and Lee were determined to make it the most famous and remarkable theatre. Because this desire for the best, Lee used only the finest materials and most marvelous decor. However, with the Great Depression deepening, they soon ran out of budget so Lee was forced to forgo some of his ambitious creative ideas including a music room off the basement lounge, an infirmary, and two other periscope projection systems for the music room and the outside lobby. Even so the Los Angeles Theatre’s remains stunning throughout the years.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, due to its grandeur and magnificence, the Los Angeles Theatre was a common filming destination for many movies, especially from the 90’s till today. Join us in a tour around one of the most lavish movie palaces in Los Angeles based on Lee’s special blueprints, and see if you recognize any familiar scenes that was shot in the Los Angeles!</p>
