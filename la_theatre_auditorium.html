                                        The auditorium features a decorative curtain that depicts a courtly scene in three dimensions, with painted figures wearing skirts of real fabric and wigs of braided wool. The great seal of the City of los Angeles hangs above the proscenium arch, in tribute to the theater’s namesake. Click on the different sections floor for more information.

                                                    The main stage drape is an incredible three-dimensional scene rendered in silk, depicting events in the life of Louis XIV.  The figures depicted on the curtain include Louis XIV, his wife, his mistress, and the French army and navy. The center of the curtain is dominated by a large triumphal arch surrounded by clouds and the rays of the sun, done in metallic gold and silver thread. It is said to be one of the most expensive drapes ever made for a movie palace.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Meanwhile, the screen illustrates the ‘classical’ screen format with an aspect ratio of 4:3. This was the screen format established in 1906 as the international standard for film width and projection. The movie screen also measured almost 60 feet wide by 30 feet high, making it one of the largest in the city. It was built to accommodate the early Magnascope wide-screen process, which unfortunately never really caught on. </p>

                                                    Here we can see the courtly scenes on the main stage drape as shown in Christopher Nolan’s film, The Prestige

                                                <p>Aside from its magnificent decor, the Los Angeles was also the most technically advanced theater of its day. The lighting was controlled by a special Westinghouse dimming system that is as flexible as any available today – in fact the dimmers themselves are still in use today.</p>
                                                <p>The sound system in the Los Angeles was also the most modern available. Not only was it state-of-the-art, it also had an extensive public address system with amplifiers that powered speakers and microphones hidden throughout the theater. Announcements could be made to patrons in various rooms and the lounge, and the film audio could be piped to those in the waiting areas and the lobby to entice visitors. This was the one of the first auditoriums to be ‘tuned’ for amplified sound, while most movie palaces of the 20’s had to undergo architectural and decorative changes to include amplified sound.</p>
                                                <p>We get a view of the auditorium seats in the films Hail Caesar!, and The Prestige.</p>

It accommodates up to 2000 people who are waiting for the next showing. This was a great contrast to the earlier theatre lobbies which were typically very cramped.</p>
                                                <p>Due to its opulence, the foyer and the staircase became the backdrop for many iconic movies, including Funny Lady, Charlie’s Angels, and Chaplin. In Herbert Ross’ film Funny Lady starring Barbara Streisand, we can see the crystal fountain and the foyer featured as Fanny Brice leaves the auditorium.

                                                <p>The use of neon lighting was another early innovation. When the theater was completed in 1931, neon lighting was only a few years old and had not been used extensively in theatres. Lee used neon not only on the exterior vertical marquee, but also as aisle lighting in the main auditorium. Blue neon tubes were imbedded under strips of 2 inch thick glass on each side of the main aisles, providing a gentle glow in the darkened theatre. Again Lee was well ahead of his time – similar strip lighting is now used in the aisles of most modern multiplexes.</p>
