                                        The basement floor was designed as entertainment for the next crowd that was waiting for the next show. There were multiple entertainment spaces to keep the crowd happy and excited before the next show such as children’s playroom, refreshment room with a soda fountains, marvelous restrooms. Click on the different sections for more information. Interestingly, the Music Room as shown on the blueprint was never built so we haven’t been able to find what the room was intended for. The one clue is that blueprint shows a lot of screens. What do you think it was meant for?
